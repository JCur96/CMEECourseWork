My CMEE Coursework Repository

Getting Started 
All work has been conducted in Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver). 

Intro - 
Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (or CMEE) is a one year masters course, this repository is the coursework generated as part of that masters. 
Each week is split into a seperate directory, labelled as such (e.g. Week1), which is in turn split into three sub directories (Code, Data and Sandbox). The titles for each are fairly self explanatory, with Code containing any code written (be it scripts, bash commands or otherwise), Data contains data, both processed and raw, and Sandbox is a place for playing with new code and files. 

Why the Git? 
This git is used to push each weeks work to by 5pm Wednesday of the following week for marking.
