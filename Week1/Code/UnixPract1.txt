# Desc: Unix Commands, covering finding and counting in numerous files
# Arguments: vary for each command

# 
wc -l ../Data/407228326.fasta &&  wc -l ../Data/407228412.fasta &&  wc -l ../Data/E.coli.fasta  #1
# - counting file lines 'wc' is the word counting command, '-l' 
# specifies that we are counting lines. && is just adding commands to the string
#
grep -v '>' ../Data/E.coli.fasta #2
# printing everything after the
# second line for the E. coli genome. grep is a pattern matching command 
# that by default prints output, in this case after matching all lines 
# beginning '>' (-v is the inverse function i.e. grep finds 
# all lines that do not match the specified pattern) 
#
tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '[:space:]'  | wc -m  #3 
# tail displays last lines of a file -n modifies to start at 
# a particular point, in this case the second line of the file (+2)
# tr -d is deletion of all '[:spaces:]', 
# wc, word count, specifying characters are to be counted (-m)
# 
tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o 'ATGC' | wc -l #4
# tail is used to start from the second line down (so excludes the header
# from all further commands) 
# commands are piped (|) together to allow them to happen in sequence on one
# line
# tr -d deletes all the ('\n') new line characters
# grep -o finds all the parts of the now single line that match the sequence
# and outputs all of these on new single lines 
# wc -l counts the number of these new lines
#
echo $(tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o [A,T] | wc -l) /  $(tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o [G,C] | wc -l) | bc -l #5
# echo - prints the end result of the equation, in this case a ratio displayed as a decimal
# tail allows us to start at the second line, which means we ignore this files header
# tr - translates (in this case removes) the new line special characters
# grep -o finds all the matching characters and places them on new lines 
# wc - l counts these new lines 
# the '/' in the middle denotes dividing one equation by the other
# bc is an arbitrary precision calculator -l loads mathlib which is a standard math library, allowing interpretation of the backslash as a division symbol
