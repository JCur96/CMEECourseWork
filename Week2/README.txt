Readme file for week2 (Python 1!)

This week is Python I, so going through the basics o fthis language, 

Directories: Code, Data, Results and Sandbox 


Code:
align_seqs.py - aligns DNA sequences from an input file then ouptuts the best alignment and its score to a results file called BestMatch.txt in Results! 

basic_csv.py - python script for opening and reading a csv file containing species and body mass data, and subsequently creating a file containing only species name and body mass.

basic_io.py - First python script I've written, reads a basic text file, and demonstrates various 
loop functions that can be written in python to edit the text file.

boilerplate.py - A basic boilerplate program for python! Prints the statement 'This is a boilerplate' after importing the sys module, and closes the program once its done

cfexercises1.py - Some functions exemplifying control statements

cfexercises2.py - Some more functions exemplifying control statements

control_flow.py - Even more functions exemplifying control statements

debugme.py - Creates a program with a bug, then lets you debug it!

dictionary.py - Making a dictionary from a list 

lc1.py - Using list comprehension and traditional loops to make lists from a nested tuple

lc2.py - Using list comprehension to create lists of tuples

loops.py - loops in python

oaks.py - Examples of list comprehension in python vs loops

oaks_debugme.py - Debugging the oaks script using break points and doc testing

scope.py - Demonstrates local and global variables 

sysargv.py - Demonstrates system argument

test_control_flow.py - Testing using doctests

tuple.py - Printing elements of a tuple on new lines and removing the brackets to make it look prettier

using_name.py - Using modules. Can be run as a self standing program or imported from another module - it tells you which it's doing!

Data:
JustOaksData.csv - The output of oaks_debugme.py 

TestOaksData.csv - the input of oaks_debugme.py

bodymass.csv - the output file for basic_csv.py

seqs.csv - the input file for align_seqs.py

testcsv.csv - the input file for basic_csv

Results:
BestMatch.txt - the output for align_seqs.py


Sandbox:
temporarytxt.txt - file made when testing code blocks

test.txt - input file for basic_io.py

testout.txt - output file for basic_io.py

testp.p - output file from pickle in basic_io.py
