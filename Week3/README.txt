Week3 Readme file

Code:
apply1.R: apply: applying the same function to rows/colums of a matrix
apply2.R: makes a function that can then be applied over matrices using the apply family
basic_io.R: A boilerplate R script
boilerplate.R: A boilerplate R script
break.R: Showing how to break out of loops 
browse.R: Runs a simulation of exponential growth 
control.R: Some code exemplifying control flow constructs in R
DataWrang.R: Wrangling the Pound Hill Dataset using the tidyverse
DataWrandTidy.R: Wrangling the Pound Hill Dataset 
get_TreeHeight.R: This function calculates the height of trees given the distance of each tree from its base and angle to its top, using the trigonometric formula
maps.R: Mapping practical
next.R: Showing use of the next statement in within a loop next allows skipping to the next iteration 
PP_Lattice.R: exemplifies the use of the lattice function
preallocate.R: exmplifying preallocating memory to save system time
Ricker.R: Runs a simulation of the Ricker model returns a vector of length generations
run_get_TreeHeight.sh: A simple shell script that calls the get_TreeHeights R script, using the trees.csv file as input data
sample.R: run a simulation that involves sampling from a population
TAutoCorr.R: This script calculates the autocorrelation between years and shows that this correlation is significantly different from random
TreeHeight.R: This function calculates the height of trees given the distance of each tree from its base and angle to its top, using the trigonometric formula
try.R: run a simulation that involves sampling from a population with try function
Vectorize1.R: using vecotorisation to save system time
Vectorize2.R: Runs the stochastic (with gaussian fluctuations) Ricker Eqn, then shows how it can be vectorized to speed up the time it takes

Data:
EcolArchives-E089-51-D1.csv: data for visualization practicals
GPDDFiltered.RData: data for maps.R
KeyWestAnnualMeanTemperature.RData: data for TAutoCorr.R
PoundHillData.csv: data for DataWrang.R
PoundHillMetaData.csv: metadata for DataWrang.R
TempAutoCor.tex: the source code for making a latex pdf
trees.csv: data in for basic_io.R

Results:
MyData.csv: data out from  basic_io.R
TempAutoCor.pdf: the pdf from temperature autocorrelation practical
TreeHts.csv: data from running TreeHeights.R
trees_TreeHeight.csv: output from get_tree_heights.sh

Sandbox:
Assorted R.R: assorted useful R code that I was playing with
